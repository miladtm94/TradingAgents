"""Historical smoke test: run the full agent pipeline on past dates and score
each decision against what the stock actually did afterward.

There is no dedicated backtest engine in this repo (backtrader is an unused
dependency) — this script is the loop-over-dates approach the README's
"Reproducibility" section describes. Each date runs a full multi-agent LLM
pipeline, so keep the date list short against a free-tier provider quota.

Usage:
    python scripts/backtest.py NVDA 2025-01-15 2025-02-14 2025-03-17
